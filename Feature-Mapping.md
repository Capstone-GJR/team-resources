Linked below is the product overview pdf for our QR code storage organization app (to be named at a later date).

This pdf was created by Jenny Austin under the request of myself, Ramaj Johnson. 
Because the idea and vision for this product was brought to the group via Jenny's suggestion, due to her frustration with the overall user experience of similar apps that are on the market, I decided to place her in the role of Product Owner. 
In this capacity, she was asked to create a list of key features that we would need to implement in order to address the shortcomings of similar products she'd previously experienced. 
What she delivered was a high level design and user flow that lays out all potential functionalities as well as sets a template for potential UI/UX designs.

Upon registration and login, a user can have multiple storage locations. 
Each location can contain multiple rooms, each with multiple boxes and/or unboxed items assigned to them with the use of QR code labels. 
Full CRUD functionality will be available for: Locations, Rooms, Boxes, Items.
